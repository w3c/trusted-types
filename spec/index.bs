# Introduction # {#introduction}

*This section is not normative.*

Certain classes of vulnerabilities occur when a web application
takes a value from an attacker-controlled source (e.g. the
document URL parameter, or postMessage channel) and passes that value,
without appropriate sanitization to one of the
[[#injection-sinks|injection sinks]] - various Web API functions with
powerful capabilities.

These types of issues are traditionally difficult to prevent.
Applications commonly call those injection sinks with attacker-controlled
values without authors realizing it, since it's not clear if the
input was attacker-controlled when invoking the injection sink.
Due to the dynamic nature of JavaScript it's also difficult to ascertain
that such pattern is not present in a given program. It is often missed
during manual code reviews, and automated code analysis. As an example,
if `aString` contains untrusted data, `foo[bar] = aString` is a statement
that potentially can trigger a vulnerability, depending on a value
of `foo` and `bar`.

This document focuses on preventing DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting
that occurs when attacker-controlled data reaches
[[#dom-xss-injection-sinks]], as that eventually causes execution of the
script payload controlled by the attacker. DOM XSS is prevalent in the
web applications as there are over 60 different
injection sinks (e.g. `Element.innerHTML`, or `Location.href` setters).

This document defines [[#trusted-types|Trusted Types]] - an API that allows applications
to lock down [=injection sinks=] to only accept non-spoofable, typed values
in place of strings. These values can in turn only be created from
application-defined [=policies=], allowing the authors to define rules
guarding dangerous APIs, reducing the attack surface to small, isolated parts
of the web application codebase, which are substantially easier to safeguard,
monitor and review.





## Goals ## {#goals}

*   Minimize the likelihood of client-side vulnerabilities that occur when
    calling powerful Web APIs with untrusted data - for example,
    minimize the likelihood of DOM XSS.

*   Encourage a design in which security decisions are
    encapsulated within a small part of the application.

*   Reduce security review surface for complex web application
    codebases.

*   Allow the usability-preserving detection of vulnerabilities similar to how regular
    programming errors are detected and surfaced to the developers, with the
    assist of dynamic and static analysis tools.

## Non-goals ## {#non-goals}

*   Prevent, or mitigate the result of injections into server-side generated
    markup, in specific reflections into the body of the scripts running in a
    document. To address server-side XSS vectors, we recommend existing
    solutions like templating systems or [[CSP3|CSP]]
    [=script-src=].
*   Address resource confinement, e.g. to prevent data exfiltration, or
    connecting to external sources via [[Fetch]].
*   Control subresource loading. Trusted Types aim to allow the authors to
    control loading resources that can script the current document, but not
    other subresources.
*   Prevent *cross-origin* JavaScript execution (for example, Trusted Types
    don't guard loading new documents with JavaScript code via `data:` URLs).
*   Prevent malicious authors of the web application's JavaScript code
    from being able to bypass the restrictions; attempting to protect against
    malicious authors would result in an overly complex and not-practical
    design.

## Use cases ## {#use-cases}

*   An author maintains a complex web application written in a framework
    that uses a secure templating system to generate the UI
    components. The application also depends on 3rd party client-side
    libraries that perform auxiliary tasks (e.g. analytics, performance
    monitoring). To ensure that none of these components introduce DOM
    XSS vulnerabilities, author defines a Trusted Type policy in the
    templating library and enables the enforcement for the [[#dom-xss-injection-sinks]].

*   A website uses [[#dom-xss-injection-sinks]]. The website-developer adds trusted
    types to it and monitors violations by using the
    <a http-header>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</a> header field.
    Violations are iteratively fixed by refactoring the code to use only safe
    methods. Afterwards, no [[#dom-xss-injection-sinks]] are called anymore.
    Hence, no trusted types are required anymore. The developer switches the
    report-only mode off and disables trusted type policies with the
    [=trusted-types-directive|trusted-types=] and the
    [=require-trusted-types-for-directive|require-trusted-types-for=]
    directives.
    The website's functionality was never impaired during the refactorings.

*   A large team maintains a complex client-side application.
    They create a number of Trusted Types policies that satisfy the security
    requirements for the application. The team consolidates the policy
    implementations and the safe abstractions that use them in a small number
    of heavily reviewed files and requires extra approval for commits that
    affect these files.

    The need to create trusted values to affect [=injection sinks=],
    combined with additional scrutiny on changes that affect policy
    code, incents developers to use safe abstractions instead of writing ad-hoc
    string composition code when interacting with [[#dom-xss-injection-sinks]].

    When considering the risk of DOM XSS, security auditors find a
    small attack surface; they focus on the small amount of code that
    crafts the CSP header and provides the safe abstractions, and ignore the
    bulk of client-side application code.

*   An existing web application interacts with the DOM mostly using XSS-safe
    patterns (i.e. without using [[#dom-xss-injection-sinks]]). In a few places,
    however, it resorts to using risky patterns like loading additional script using
    JSONP, calling into `innerHTML` or `eval`.

    Review finds that those places do not cause XSS (e.g. because
    user-controlled data is not part of the input to those sinks), but it's
    hard to migrate the application off using these patterns.

    As such, CSP cannot be enforced on this application (without resorting to
    an unsafe version using `'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'`). Additionally,
    it's possible some codebase with DOM XSS flaws was not included in a review,
    or will be introduced in the future.

    To address this risk, the author converts the reviewed parts to using
    Trusted Types, and enables Trusted Type [=enforcement=]. Additional places
    using the injection sinks, should they exist in the future, are correctly
    blocked and reported.

*   A security team is tasked with assuring that the client-side heavy
    application code does not contain XSS vulnerabilities. Since the server side
    code is homogeneous (it's mostly an API backend), and the application
    enforces Trusted Types, the review only focuses on the Trusted Type
    [=policies=] and their rules. Later on the reviewed policy names are
    allowed in the 'trusted-types' CSP directive, safe for the developers to
    use.

    Any additional code, including the code of often-changing dependencies,
    can be excluded from the review, unless it creates a Trusted Type policy.
    Without it, the code cannot cause a DOM XSS.

# Framework # {#framework}

## Injection sinks ## {#injection-sinks}

*This section is not normative.*

An <dfn>injection sink</dfn> is a powerful Web API function that should only
be called with trusted, validated or appropriately sanitized input.
Calling the injection sink with attacker-controlled (i.e. injected) inputs
has undesired consequences and is considered a security vulnerability.

Note: The exact list of injection sinks covered by this document is defined in
[[#integrations]].

It's difficult to determine if a given application contains such a
vulnerability (e.g. if it is vulnerable to DOM XSS) only by analyzing
the invocations of [=injection sinks=], as their inputs (usually strings)
do not carry the information about their provenance. For example, while
the application might intentionally call `eval()` with dynamically created
inputs (e.g. for code obfuscation purposes), calling `eval()` on strings
supplied by the attacker is definitely a security vulnerability - but
it's not easy to distinguish one from the other.

This document organizes the injection sinks into groups, based on the
capabilities that sinks in a given group have. [=Enforcement=] for groups is controlled via <a>trusted-types-sink-group</a> values.

### DOM XSS injection sinks ### {#dom-xss-injection-sinks}

*This section is not normative.*

DOM XSS <a>injection sinks</a>  evaluate an input string value in a way that could
result in DOM XSS if that value is untrusted.

Examples include:

  * Setters for {{Element}} attributes that accept a URL of the code to load
    like {{HTMLScriptElement/src!!attribute|HTMLScriptElement.src}},
  * Setters for {{Element}} attributes that accept a code to execute like
    {{HTMLScriptElement/text!!attribute|HTMLScriptElement.text}},
  * Functions that execute code directly like `eval`,
  * Navigation to 'javascript:' URLs.

Since HTML parsers can create arbitrary elements, including scripts, and set arbitrary attributes,
DOM XSS <a>injection sinks</a> also include HTML parsing sinks:

  * Functions that parse & insert HTML strings into the document like
    {{Element/innerHTML|Element.innerHTML}},
    {{ShadowRoot/innerHTML|ShadowRoot.innerHTML}},
    and {{Element/outerHTML|Element.outerHTML}} setters, or Document.write.
  * Functions that create a new same-origin {{Document}} with caller-controlled
    markup like {{DOMParser/parseFromString()}}.

Guarding DOM XSS injection sinks is controlled by the <a>trusted-types-sink-group</a> named 'script'.

## Trusted Types ## {#trusted-types}

To allow the authors to control values reaching injection sinks,
we introduce [[#trusted-types]]. The following list of
<dfn>Trusted Type</dfn>s indicating that a given value is
trusted by the authors to be used with an [=injection sink=] in a certain context.

Note: **Trusted** in this context signifies the fact that the application author
is confident that a given value can be safely used with an injection sink - she
*trusts* it does not introduce a vulnerability. That does not imply that the
value is indeed *safe*.

Note: This allows the authors to specify the intention when creating a given
value, and the user agents to introduce checks based on the type of
such value to preserve the authors' intent. For example, if
authors intend a value to be used as an HTML snippet, an attempt to
load a script from that value would fail.

Note: All Trusted Types wrap over an immutable string, specified when the
objects are created. These objects are unforgeable in a sense that
there is no JavaScript-exposed way to replace the inner string value
of a given object - it's stored in an internal slot with no setter
exposed.

Note: All Trusted Types stringifiers return the inner string value.
This makes it easy to incrementally migrate the application code into using
Trusted Types in place of DOM strings (it's possible to start
producing types in parts of the application, while still using and
accepting strings in other parts of the codebase). In that sense,
Trusted Types are backwards-compatible with the regular DOM APIs.

### <dfn interface>TrustedHTML</dfn> ### {#trusted-html}

The TrustedHTML interface represents a string that a developer can
confidently insert into an [=injection sink=] that will render it as HTML.
These objects are immutable
wrappers around a string, constructed via a {{TrustedTypePolicy}}'s
{{TrustedTypePolicy/createHTML(input)|createHTML}} method.

<pre class="idl">
[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
interface TrustedHTML {
  stringifier;
  DOMString toJSON();
};
</pre>

TrustedHTML objects have an associated string <dfn export for="TrustedHTML">data</dfn>.
The value is set when the object is created, and will never change during its lifetime.

<dfn method for="TrustedHTML">toJSON()</dfn> method steps and the
<dfn dfn for="TrustedHTML">stringification behavior</dfn> steps of a
TrustedHTML object are to return the associated [=TrustedHTML/data=] value.

### <dfn interface>TrustedScript</dfn> ### {#trusted-script}

The TrustedScript interface represents a string with an uncompiled
script body that a developer can confidently pass into an [=injection sink=]
that might lead to executing that script.
These objects are immutable wrappers
around a string, constructed via a {{TrustedTypePolicy}}'s
{{TrustedTypePolicy/createScript(input)|createScript}} method.

<pre class="idl">
[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
interface TrustedScript {
  stringifier;
  DOMString toJSON();
};
</pre>

TrustedScript objects have an associated string <dfn export for="TrustedScript">data</dfn>.
The value is set when the object is created, and will never change during its lifetime.

<dfn method for="TrustedScript">toJSON()</dfn> method steps and the
<dfn for="TrustedScript">stringification behavior</dfn> steps of a
TrustedScript object are to return the associated [=TrustedScript/data=] value.

### <dfn interface>TrustedScriptURL</dfn> ### {#trused-script-url}

The TrustedScriptURL interface represents a string that a developer
can confidently pass into an [=injection sink=] that will parse it as a URL of
an external script resource.
These objects are immutable wrappers around a
string, constructed via a {{TrustedTypePolicy}}'s
{{TrustedTypePolicy/createScriptURL(input)|createScriptURL}} method.

<pre class="idl">
[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
interface TrustedScriptURL {
  stringifier;
  USVString toJSON();
};
</pre>

TrustedScriptURL objects have an associated string <dfn export for="TrustedScriptURL">data</dfn>.
The value is set when the object is created, and will never change during its lifetime.

<dfn method for="TrustedScriptURL">toJSON()</dfn> method steps and the
<dfn for="TrustedScriptURL">stringification behavior</dfn> steps of a
TrustedScriptURL object are to return the associated [=TrustedScriptURL/data=] value.

## <dfn>Policies</dfn> ## {#policies-hdr}

Trusted Types can only be created via user-defined
and immutable policies that define rules for converting a string into
a given Trusted Type object. Policies allows the authors to specify custom,
programmatic rules that Trusted Types must adhere to.

<div class="example" id="sanitizing-policy">
Authors may define a
policy that will sanitize an HTML string, allowing only a subset of
tags and attributes that are known not to cause JavaScript
execution. Any {{TrustedHTML}} object created through this policy can then
be safely used in the application, and e.g. passed to `innerHTML`
setter - even if the input value was controlled by the attacker, the
policy rules neutralized it to adhere to policy-specific
contract.
<xmp highlight=js>
const sanitizingPolicy = trustedTypes.createPolicy('sanitize-html', {
  createHTML: (input) => myTrustedSanitizer(input, { superSafe: 'ok'}),
});

myDiv.innerHTML = sanitizingPolicy.createHTML(untrustedValue);
</xmp>
</div>

Note: [=Trusted Type=] objects wrap values that are explicitly trusted by
the author. As such, creating a Trusted Type object instance becomes a de
facto [=injection sink=], and hence code that creates a Trusted Type
instances is security-critical. To allow for strict control over Trusted Type
object creation we don't expose the constructors of those
directly, but require authors to create them via [=policies=].

Multiple policies can be created in a given [=Realm=], allowing the
applications to define different rules for different parts of the
codebase.

<div class="example" id="policy-reference">
Library initialized with a policy allowing it to load additional scripts from
a given host.
<xmp highlight=js>

const cdnScriptsPolicy = trustedTypes.createPolicy('cdn-scripts', {
  createScriptURL(url) {
    const parsed = new URL(url, document.baseURI);
    if (parsed.origin == 'https://mycdn.example') {
      return url;
    }
    throw new TypeError('invalid URL');
  },
});

myLibrary.init({policy: cdnScriptsPolicy});

</div>

Note: Trusted Type objects can only be created via policies. If
[=enforcement=] is enabled, only the policy code can trigger an action
of an [=injection sink=] and hence call-sites of the policies' `create*`
functions are the *only* security-sensitive code in the entire program
with regards to the actions of the [=injection sinks=].
Only this typically small subset of the entire code base needs to be
security-reviewed - there's no need to monitor or review
the [=injection sinks=] themselves, as User Agents [=enforcement|enforce=] that
those sinks will only accept matching Trusted Type objects, and these in turn
can only be created via policies.

The {{TrustedTypePolicyFactory/createPolicy()|createPolicy}} function returns a policy object which `create*` functions
will create Trusted Type objects after applying the policy
rules.

Note: While it's safe to freely use a policy that sanitizes its input anywhere in the application,
there might be a need to create lax policies to be used internally, and only to be
called with author-controlled input. For example, a client-side HTML
templating library, an HTML sanitizer library, or a JS asynchronous
code plugin loading subsystem each will likely need full control over
HTML or URLs. The API design facilitates that - each policy may only
be used if the callsite can obtain a reference to the policy (a return
value from {{TrustedTypePolicyFactory/createPolicy()}}). As such, policy
references can be treated as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">capabilities</a>,
access to which can be controlled using JavaScript techniques
(e.g. via closures, internal function variables, or modules).

</pre>

### <dfn data-lt="default-policy-explanation">Default policy</dfn> ### {#default-policy-hdr}

*This section is not normative.*

One of the policies, the policy with a [=TrustedTypePolicy/name=] `"default"`, is special;
When an [=injection sink=] is passed a string (instead of a
Trusted Type object), this policy will be implicitly called by
the user agent with the non trusted string value, Trusted Type of the sink and
the sink type, respectively.

This allows the application to define a fallback behavior to use instead of
causing a violation. The intention is to allow the applications to recover from
an unexpected data flow, and sanitize the
potentially attacker-controlled string "as a last resort", or reject a value
if a safe value cannot be created. Errors thrown from within a policy are
propagated to the application.

If the default policy doesn't exist, or if its appropriate `create*` function
returns *null* or *undefined*, it will cause a CSP violation. In the
enforcing mode, an error will be thrown, but in report-only the original value
passed to the default policy will be used.

Note: This optional behavior allows for introducing Trusted Type [=enforcement=]
to applications that are still using legacy code that uses injection sinks.
Needless to say, this policy should
necessarily be defined with very strict rules not to bypass the security
restrictions in unknown parts of the application. In an extreme
case, a lax, no-op default policy defeats all the benefits of using Trusted Types
to protect access to [=injection sinks=]. If possible,
authors should resort to a default policy in a transitional period
only, use it to detect and rewrite their dependencies that use injection
sinks unsafely and eventually phase out the usage of the default policy entirely.

Note: See [[#get-trusted-type-compliant-string-algorithm]] for details on how
the default policy is applied.

<div class="example" id="default-policy-example">
<xmp highlight="js">
// Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types default; require-trusted-types-for 'script'

trustedTypes.createPolicy('default', {
  createScriptURL: (value, type, sink) => {
    console.log("Please refactor.");
    return value + '?default-policy-used&type=' + encodeURIComponent(type) +
          '&sink=' + encodeURIComponent(sink);
  }
});

aScriptElement.src = "https://cdn.example/script.js";
// Please refactor.
console.log(aScriptElement.src);
// https://cdn.example/script.js?default-policy-used&type=TrustedScriptURL&sink=HTMLScriptElement%20src
</xmp>
</div>


## <dfn>Enforcement</dfn> ## {#enforcement-hdr}

Note: Enforcement is the process of checking that a value
has an appropriate type before it reaches an [=injection sink=].

The JavaScript API that allows authors to create policies and Trusted Types objects from them is always
available (via {{WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/trustedTypes}}). Since [=injection sinks=] stringify their security sensitive
arguments, and [=Trusted Type=] objects stringify to their inner string values, this allows the authors
to use Trusted Types in place of strings.

To secure the access to [=injection sinks=], on top of the JavaScript code using the Trusted Types,
the user agent needs to enforce them i.e. assert that the injection sinks from a given group are *never*
called with string values, and Trusted Type values are used instead. This section describes how authors
may control this enforcing behavior.

Authors may also control their [=policies=] by specifying rules around policy creation.

### Content Security Policy ### {#content-security-policy-hdr}

Applications may control Trusted Type enforcement via [[CSP#policy-delivery|configuring a Content Security Policy]]. This document defines new directives that correspond to Trusted Types rules.
The [=require-trusted-types-for-directive|require-trusted-types-for=] directive specifies the [=injection sinks=] groups, for which the types should be required. The [[#trusted-types-csp-directive|trusted-types]] directive controls how [=policies=] can be created.

Note: Using CSP mechanisms allows the authors to prepare their application for enforcing Trusted Types
via using the <a http-header>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</a> HTTP Response header.

Note: Most of the enforcement rules are defined as modifications of the
algorithms in other specifications, see [[#integrations]].

1.  Let |sink| be "`HTMLScriptElement text`" if |script| is an {{HTMLScriptElement}}; otherwise "`SVGScriptElement text`".

1.  If |script|'s [=script text=] value is not equal to its [=child text content=],
    set |script|'s [=script text=] to the result of executing [=Get Trusted Type compliant string=], with the following arguments:

To <dfn export>get Trusted Types-compliant attribute value</dfn> given a string |attributeName|, string |attributeNs|, {{Element}} |element| and {{TrustedType}} or a string |newValue|, perform the following steps:

1. If |attributeNs| is the empty string, set |attributeNs| to null.
1. Set |attributeData| to the result of [=Get Trusted Type data for attribute=] algorithm, with the following arguments:
    * |element|
    * |attributeName|
    * |attributeNs|
1. If |attributeData| is null, then:
    1. If |newValue| is a string, return |newValue|.
    1. <a>Assert</a>: |newValue| is {{TrustedHTML}} or {{TrustedScript}} or {{TrustedScriptURL}}.
    1. Return |value|'s associated data.
1. Let |expectedType| be the value of the fourth member of |attributeData|.
1. Let |sink| be the value of the fifth member of |attributeData|.
1. Return the result of executing [=Get Trusted Type compliant string=] with the following arguments:
     * |expectedType|
     * |newValue| as |input|
     * |element|'s <a>node document</a>'s <a>relevant global object</a> as |global|
     * |sink|
     * 'script' as |sinkGroup|

   If the algorithm threw an error, rethrow the error.

## Get Trusted Type data for attribute ## {#get-trusted-type-data-for-attribute}
To <dfn>Get Trusted Type data for attribute</dfn> given |element|, |attribute|, |attributeNs|, perform the following steps:

Issue: The [=event handler content attribute=] concept used below is ambiguous. This spec needs a better mechanism to identify event handler attributes. See [https://github.com/w3c/trusted-types/issues/520](https://github.com/w3c/trusted-types/issues/520).

1. Let |data| be null.
1. If |attributeNs| is null, « [=HTML namespace=], [=SVG namespace=], [=MathML namespace=] » [=list contain|contains=] |element|'s [=element namespace|namespace=], and |attribute| is the name of an [=event handler content attribute=]:
    1. Return ({{Element}}, null, |attribute|, {{TrustedScript}}, "Element " + |attribute|).
1. Find the row in the following table, where |element| is in the first column, |attributeNs| is in the second column,
    and |attribute| is in the third column.
    If a matching row is found, set |data| to that row.

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Element<th>Attribute namespace<th>Attribute local name<th>TrustedType<th>Sink
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>{{HTMLIFrameElement}}<td>null<td>"srcdoc"<td>{{TrustedHTML}}<td>"HTMLIFrameElement srcdoc"

## Integration with HTML ## {#integration-with-html}

{{Window}} and {{Worker}} objects have a <dfn for="Window">trusted type policy factory</dfn>,
which is a {{TrustedTypePolicyFactory}} object.

### Extensions to the WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope interface ### {#extensions-to-the-windoworworkerglobalscope-interface}

This document extends the {{WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope}} interface defined by [[HTML5|HTML]]:

<pre class="idl">
partial interface mixin WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope {
  readonly attribute TrustedTypePolicyFactory trustedTypes;
};
</pre>

The {{WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/trustedTypes}} getter steps are to return [=this=]'s [=relevant global object=]'s [[#integration-with-html|trusted
type policy factory]].

### Enforcement for scripts ### {#enforcement-in-scripts}

This document modifies how {{HTMLScriptElement}} [=child text content=] can be set to allow applications to control dynamically created scripts. It does so by
adding the {{HTMLElement/innerText}} and {{Node/textContent}} attributes directly on {{HTMLScriptElement}}. The behavior of the attributes remains the same
as in their original counterparts, apart from the additional behavior of calling [=Get Trusted Type compliant string=].

Note: Using these IDL attributes is the recommended way of dynamically setting the URL or a text of a script. Manipulating attribute nodes or text nodes directly will call a default policy on the final value when the script is prepared.

<pre class="idl exclude">
partial interface HTMLScriptElement {
 [CEReactions] attribute (TrustedScript or [LegacyNullToEmptyString] DOMString) innerText;
 [CEReactions] attribute (TrustedScript or DOMString)? textContent;
 [CEReactions] attribute (TrustedScriptURL or USVString) src;
 [CEReactions] attribute (TrustedScript or DOMString) text;
};
</pre>

#### Slots with trusted values #### {#slots-with-trusted-values}

An {{HTMLScriptElement}} and {{SVGScriptElement}} have:

: an associated string <dfn export for="HTMLScriptElement,SVGScriptElement">script text</dfn>.
::  A string, containing the body of the script to execute that was set
    through a compliant sink. Equivalent to script's
    [=child text content=]. Initially an empty string.

#### The {{HTMLScriptElement/innerText}} IDL attribute #### {#the-innerText-idl-attribute}

The {{HTMLScriptElement/innerText}} setter steps are:

1.  Let |value| be the result of calling [=Get Trusted Type compliant string=] with
    {{TrustedScript}}, [=this=]'s [=relevant global object=], the given value, `HTMLScriptElement innerText`, and
    `script`.
1.  Set [=this=]'s [=script text=] value to |value|.
1.  Run [=set the inner text steps=] with [=this=] and |value|.

The {{HTMLScriptElement/innerText}} getter steps are:

1.  Return the result of running [=get the text steps=] with [=this=].

#### The {{HTMLScriptElement/textContent}} IDL attribute #### {#the-textContent-idl-attribute}

The {{HTMLScriptElement/textContent}} setter steps are to, if the given value is null, act as if it was the
empty string instead, and then do as described below:

1.  Let |value| be the result of calling [=Get Trusted Type compliant string=] with
    {{TrustedScript}}, [=this=]'s [=relevant global object=], the given value, `HTMLScriptElement textContent`, and
    `script`.
1.  Set [=this=]'s [=script text=] value to |value|.
1.  Run [=set text content=] with [=this=] and |value|.

The {{HTMLScriptElement/textContent}} getter steps are:

1.  Return the result of running [=get text content=] with [=this=].

Note: Currently we don't add an equivalent to {{SVGScriptElement}}. See [https://github.com/w3c/trusted-types/issues/512](https://github.com/w3c/trusted-types/issues/512).

#### The {{HTMLScriptElement/text}} IDL attribute #### {#the-text-idl-attribute}

Update the {{HTMLScriptElement/text}} setter steps algorithm as follows.

1.  <ins>Let |value| be the result of calling [=Get Trusted Type compliant string=] with
    {{TrustedScript}}, [=this=]'s [=relevant global object=], the given value, `HTMLScriptElement text`, and
    `script`.</ins>
1.  <ins>Set [=this=]'s [=script text=] value to the given value.</ins>
1.  [=String replace all=] with the given value within [=this=].


#### The {{HTMLScriptElement/src}} IDL attribute #### {#the-src-idl-attribute}

The {{HTMLScriptElement/src}} getter steps are:

1. <ins>Let |element| be the result of running [=this=]'s get the element.</ins>

1. <ins>Let |contentAttributeValue| be the result of running [=this=]'s get the content attribute.</ins>

1. <ins>If |contentAttributeValue| is null, then return the empty string.</ins>

1. <ins>Let |urlString| be the result of encoding-parsing-and-serializing a URL given |contentAttributeValue|, relative to |element|'s [=node document=].</ins>

1. <ins>If |urlString| is not failure, then return |urlString|.</ins>

1. <ins>Return |contentAttributeValue|, converted to a scalar value string.

The {{HTMLScriptElement/src}} setter steps are:

1.  <ins>Let |value| be the result of calling [=Get Trusted Type compliant string=] with
    {{TrustedScriptURL}}, [=this=]'s [=relevant global object=], the given value, `HTMLScriptElement src`, and
    `script`.</ins>
1.  <ins>Set [=this=]'s [=src=] content attribute to |value|.</ins>

#### Setting slot values from parser #### {#setting-slot-values-from-parser}

This document modifies the HTML parser to set the [=script text=] value when the script is created.

Modify the [=The text insertion mode=] algorithm as follows:

<dl class="switch">
    <dt id="scriptEndTag">An end tag whose tag name is "script"</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>...</p>

        <ins><p>Set <var>script</var>'s [=script text=] value to its [=child text content=].</p></ins>

        <p>If the <span>active speculative HTML parser</span> is null, then <span>prepare the script
        element</span> <var>script</var>. This might cause some script to execute, which might cause
        <span data-x="dom-document-write">new characters to be inserted into the tokenizer</span>, and
        might cause the tokenizer to output more tokens, resulting in a [=reentrant invocation of the parser=].</p>

        <p>...</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

Issue: The above algorithm doesn't account for the case when the script element's content is changed mid-parse. Implementors must ensure they protect against this case. See [https://github.com/w3c/trusted-types/issues/507](https://github.com/w3c/trusted-types/issues/507).

Issue: There's no proper definition for the processing of SVG script elements. However, implementations must apply a similar change to the processing of {{SVGScriptElement}}s.

#### Slot value verification #### {#slot-value-verification}

The first few steps of the [=prepare the script element=] algorithm are modified as follows:

  <ol>
  <li><p>If <var>el</var>'s <a href=https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#already-started id=script-processing-model:already-started-3>already started</a> is true, then return.
  <li><p>Let <var>parser document</var> be <var>el</var>'s <a href=https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#parser-document id=script-processing-model:parser-document-2>parser document</a>.
  <li>
    <p>Set <var>el</var>'s <a href=https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#parser-document id=script-processing-model:parser-document-3>parser document</a> to null.</p>

    <p class=note>This is done so that if parser-inserted <code id=script-processing-model:the-script-element-27><a href=https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-script-element>script</a></code> elements fail to run
    when the parser tries to run them, e.g. because they are empty or specify an unsupported
    scripting language, another script can later mutate them and cause them to run again.</p>
  <li>
    <p>If <var>parser document</var> is non-null and <var>el</var> does not have an <code id=script-processing-model:attr-script-async-4><a href=https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#attr-script-async>async</a></code> attribute, then set <var>el</var>'s <a href=https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#script-force-async id=script-processing-model:script-force-async-2>force async</a> to true.</p>

    <p class=note>This is done so that if a parser-inserted <code id=script-processing-model:the-script-element-28><a href=https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-script-element>script</a></code> element fails to
    run when the parser tries to run it, but it is later executed after a script dynamically
    updates it, it will execute in an async fashion even if the <code id=script-processing-model:attr-script-async-5><a href=https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#attr-script-async>async</a></code> attribute isn't set.</p>
  <li><ins><p>Execute the [=Prepare the script text=] algorithm on <var>el</var>. If that algorithm threw an error, then return.</p></ins></li>
  <li><p>Let <var ignore="">source text</var> be <var>el</var>'s <del><a id=script-processing-model:child-text-content href=https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-child-text-content data-x-internal=child-text-content>child text content</a>.</del> <ins>[=script text=] value.</ins>
  <li>...
  </ol>

Issue: There's no proper definition for the processing of SVG script elements. However, implementations must apply a similar change to the processing of {{SVGScriptElement}}s.

## Integration with DOM ## {#integration-with-dom}

Note: See [https://github.com/whatwg/dom/pull/1268](https://github.com/whatwg/dom/pull/1268) which upstreams this integration.

## Integration with Content Security Policy ## {#integration-with-content-security-policy}

### <dfn export lt="require-trusted-types-for-directive">require-trusted-types-for</dfn> directive ### {#require-trusted-types-for-csp-directive}

This document defines *require-trusted-types-for* - a new [=directive|Content Security Policy directive=].

[=require-trusted-types-for-directive|require-trusted-types-for=] directive configures the Trusted
Types framework for all the [=injection sinks=] of certain groups in a current [=Realm|realm=].
Specifically, it defines what should be the behavior when a string value is passed to an [=injection sink=]
of a given group (i.e. should the type-based enforcement be enabled for such sinks).

Note: Currently, only the enforcement for [[#dom-xss-injection-sinks]] is specified.

The syntax for the directive's [=directive/name=] and [=directive/value=] is described by the following
ABNF:

<pre>
directive-name = "require-trusted-types-for"
directive-value = <a>trusted-types-sink-group-keyword</a> *( <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-csp/#grammardef-required-ascii-whitespace">required-ascii-whitespace</a> <a>trusted-types-sink-group-keyword</a>)
<dfn>trusted-types-sink-group-keyword</dfn> = "'" <a>trusted-types-sink-group</a> "'"
<dfn>trusted-types-sink-group</dfn> = "script"
</pre>

<div class="example" id="require-tt-for-script-header">
Enforce Trusted Types at the DOM XSS injection sinks.

<pre class="http">
Content-Security-Policy: require-trusted-types-for 'script'
</pre>
</div>

#### `require-trusted-types-for` Pre-Navigation check #### {#require-trusted-types-for-pre-navigation-check}

Given a [=request=] (|request|), a string <var ignore>navigation type</var> and a [=content security policy object|policy=] (|policy|), this algorithm returns `"Blocked"`
if a navigation violates the [=require-trusted-types-for-directive|require-trusted-types-for=] directive's constraints and `"Allowed"`
otherwise. This constitutes the [=require-trusted-types-for-directive|require-trusted-types-for=] directive's [=pre-navigation check=]:

Note: This algorithm assures that the code to be executed by a navigation to a `javascript:` URL will have to pass through a
[=default-policy-explanation|default policy=]'s `createScript` function, in addition to all other restrictions imposed by other CSP directives.

1. If |request|'s [=request/url=]'s [=url/scheme=] is not `"javascript"`, return `"Allowed"` and abort further steps.
1. Let |urlString| be the result of running the [=URL serializer=] on |request|'s [=request/url=].
1. Let |encodedScriptSource| be the result of removing the leading `"javascript:"` from |urlString|.
1. Let |convertedScriptSource| be the result of executing [=Process value with a default policy=] algorithm, with the following arguments:

    * {{TrustedScript}} as |expectedType|
    * |request|'s [=request/clients=]'s [=environment settings object/global object=] as |global|
    * |encodedScriptSource| as |input|
    * `"Location href"` as |sink|

    If that algorithm threw an error or |convertedScriptSource| is not a {{TrustedScript}} object, return "Blocked" and abort further steps.
1. Set |urlString| to be the result of prepending `"javascript:"` to stringified |convertedScriptSource|.
1. Let |newURL| be the result of running the [=URL parser=] on |urlString|. If the parser returns a failure, return `"Blocked"` and abort further steps.
1. Set |request|'s [=request/url=] to |newURL|.

     Note: No other CSP directives operate on `javascript:` URLs in a pre-navigation check. Other directives that check javascript: URLs
           will operate on the modified URL later, in the [=inline check=].
1. Return `"Allowed"`.


### <dfn export lt="trusted-types-directive">trusted-types</dfn> directive ### {#trusted-types-csp-directive}

This document defines *trusted-types* - a new [=directive|Content Security Policy directive=]. The [=trusted-types-directive|trusted-types=] directive controls the creation of Trusted Type [=policies=].

The syntax for the directive's [=directive/name=] and [=directive/value=] is described by the following
ABNF:

<pre>
directive-name = "trusted-types"
directive-value = <a>serialized-tt-configuration</a>
<dfn>serialized-tt-configuration</dfn> = ( <a>tt-expression</a> *( <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-csp/#grammardef-required-ascii-whitespace">required-ascii-whitespace</a> <a>tt-expression</a> ) )
<dfn>tt-expression</dfn> = <a>tt-policy-name</a>  / <a>tt-keyword</a> / <a>tt-wildcard</a>
<dfn>tt-wildcard</dfn> = "*"
<dfn>tt-policy-name</dfn> = 1*( <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234#appendix-B.1">ALPHA</a> / <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234#appendix-B.1">DIGIT</a> / "-" / "#" / "=" / "_" / "/" / "@" / "." / "%")
<dfn>tt-keyword</dfn> = "'allow-duplicates'" / "'none'"
</pre>

<div class="example" id="allowlist-of-policy-names-in-header">
Types are enforced at sinks, and only two policies may be created: “one” and “two”.

<pre class="http">
Content-Security-Policy: require-trusted-types-for 'script'; trusted-types one two
</pre>
</div>

<div class="example" id="header-that-allows-no-policy-names">
An empty [=directive=] [=directive/value=] indicates policies may not be created,
and sinks expect Trusted Type values, i.e. no DOM XSS [=injection sinks=] can be used
at all.
<pre class="http">
Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types; require-trusted-types-for 'script'
</pre>
</div>

The keyword `'none'` may be used to explicitly express the above:
<div class="example" id="header-with-none-that-allows-no-policy-names">
<pre class="http">
Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types 'none'; require-trusted-types-for 'script'
</pre>
</div>

Keyword `'allow-duplicates'` allows for creating policies with a name that was already used.

<div class="example" id="allow-duplicates-in-header">
<pre class="http">
Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types foo bar 'allow-duplicates'
</pre>
</div>

If the policy named `default` is present in the list, it refers to the [=TrustedTypePolicyFactory/default policy=].
All strings passed to [=injection sinks=] will be passed through it instead of being rejected outright.

<div class="example" id="default-in-header">
<pre class="http">
Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types one two default
</pre>
</div>

### <dfn>Does sink type require trusted types?</dfn> ### {#does-sink-require-trusted-types}

Given a [=realm/global object=] (|global|), a string (|sinkGroup|) and a boolean (|includeReportOnlyPolicies|), this algorithm
returns `true` if the [=injection sink=] requires a [=Trusted Type=], and `false` otherwise.

1.  For each |policy| in |global|'s <a>CSP list</a>:
    1.  If |policy|'s <a>directive set</a> does not contain a <a>directive</a>
        whose [=directive/name=] is `"require-trusted-types-for"`, skip to the next |policy|.
    1.  Let |directive| be the |policy|'s |directive set|'s [=directive=] whose name
        is `"require-trusted-types-for"`
    1.  If |directive|'s [=directive/value=] does not contain a <a>trusted-types-sink-group</a> which is a match

    1.  If |includeReportOnlyPolicies| is true, return true.
1. Return false.

### <dfn>Should sink type mismatch violation be blocked by Content Security Policy?</dfn> ### {#should-block-sink-type-mismatch}

Given a [=realm/global object=] (|global|), a string (|sink|), a string (|sinkGroup|) and a string (|source|) this algorithm
returns `"Blocked"` if the [=injection sink=] requires a [=Trusted Type=], and
`"Allowed"` otherwise.

1.  Let |result| be `"Allowed"`.
1.  Let |sample| be |source|.
1.  If |sink| is `"Function"`, then:
    1. If |sample| starts with `"function anonymous"`, strip that from |sample|.
    1. Otherwise if |sample| starts with `"async function anonymous"`, strip that from |sample|.
    1. Otherwise if |sample| starts with `"function* anonymous"`, strip that from |sample|.
    1. Otherwise if |sample| starts with `"async function* anonymous"`, strip that from |sample|.
1.  For each |policy| in |global|'s <a>CSP list</a>:
    1.  If |policy|'s <a>directive set</a> does not contain a <a>directive</a>
        whose [=directive/name=] is `"require-trusted-types-for"`, skip to the next |policy|.
    1.  Let |directive| be the |policy|'s |directive set|'s [=directive=] whose name
        is `"require-trusted-types-for"`
    1.  If |directive|'s [=directive/value=] does not contain a <a>trusted-types-sink-group</a> which is a match
        for |sinkGroup|, skip to the next |policy|.
    1.  Let |violation| be the result of executing
        [[CSP#create-violation-for-global|Create a violation object for global, policy, and directive]]
        on |global|, |policy| and `"require-trusted-types-for"`
    1. Set |violation|'s [=violation/resource=] to `"trusted-types-sink"`.
    1. Let |trimmedSample| be the substring of |sample|, containing its first 40 characters.
    1. Set |violation|'s [=violation/sample=] to be the result of [=concatenating=] the list &laquo; |sink|, |trimmedSample| &laquo; using `"|"` as a separator.
    1.  Execute [[CSP#report-violation|Report a violation]] on |violation|.

1. Return |result|.

### <dfn>Should Trusted Type policy creation be blocked by Content Security Policy?</dfn> ### {#should-block-create-policy}

Given a [=realm/global object=] (|global|), a string (|policyName|) and a list of
strings (|createdPolicyNames|), this algorithm returns `"Blocked"` if the
{{TrustedTypePolicy}} should not be created, and `"Allowed"` otherwise.

1.  Let |result| be `"Allowed"`.
1.  For each |policy| in |global|'s <a>CSP list</a>:
    1.  Let |createViolation| be false.
    1.  If |policy|'s <a>directive set</a> does not contain a <a>directive</a>

    1.  If |directive|'s [=directive/value=] only contains a <a>tt-keyword</a> which
        is a match for a value `'none'`, set |createViolation| to true.

        Note: Like in other CSP directives, 'none' keyword will be ignored if other keywords or policy names are present.

    1.  If |createdPolicyNames| contains |policyName| and |directive|'s [=directive/value=] does not contain a <a>tt-keyword</a> which is a match
        for a value `'allow-duplicates'`, set |createViolation| to true.

        Note: `trusted-types policyA policyB 'allow-duplicates'` allows authors to create policies with
        duplicated names.
    1.  If |directive|'s [=directive/value=] does not contain a <a>tt-policy-name</a>,
        which value is |policyName|, and |directive|'s [=directive/value=] does not contain a <a>tt-wildcard</a>, set |createViolation| to true.

        Note: `trusted-types *` allows authors to create policies with any unique names. To allow for multiple policies with the same name, use
        `trusted-types * 'allow-duplicates'` or don't set the `trusted-types` directive at all.
    1.  If |createViolation| is false, skip to the next |policy|.
    1.  Let |violation| be the result of executing
        [[CSP#create-violation-for-global|Create a violation object for global, policy, and directive]] on |global|, |policy| and
        `"trusted-types"`
    1. Set |violation|'s [=violation/resource=] to `"trusted-types-policy"`.
    1. Set |violation|'s [=violation/sample=] to the substring of |policyName|, containing its first 40 characters.
    1.  Execute [[CSP#report-violation|Report a violation]] on |violation|.
    1.  If |policy|'s [=policy/disposition=] is `"enforce"`, then set |result| to
        `"Blocked"`.
1. Return |result|.

# Security Considerations # {#security-considerations}

Trusted Types are not intended to protect access to [=injection sinks=] in an
actively malicious execution environment. It's assumed that the application is
written by non-malicious authors; the intent is to prevent developer mistakes
that could result in security bugs, and not to defend against first-party
malicious code actively trying to bypass policy restrictions. Below we enumerate
already identified vectors that remain risky even in environments with enforced
Trusted Types.

## Cross-document vectors ## {#cross-document-vectors}

While the code running in a window in which Trusted Types are enforced cannot
dynamically create nodes that would bypass the policy restrictions, it is
possible that such nodes can be imported or adopted from documents in other
windows, that don't have the same set of restrictions. In essence - it is
possible to bypass Trusted Types if a malicious author creates a setup in which
a restricted document colludes with an unrestricted one. In an extreme case, the
restricted document might create a {{Blob}} from strings and navigate to it.

CSP propagation rules (see [[CSP3#security-inherit-csp]] partially address this
issue, as new [=local scheme=] documents will inherit the same set of restrictions,
so - for example -  `script-src` restrictions could be used to make sure injections
into {{Blob}} contents would not execute scripts. To address this issue
comprehensively, other mechanisms like <a href="https://wicg.github.io/origin-policy/">Origin Policy</a>
should be used to ensure that baseline security rules are applied for the whole
origin.

## Deprecated features ## {#deprecated-features}

Some long-deprecated and rarely used platform features are not subject to Trusted
Types, and could potentially be used by malicious authors to overcome the
restrictions:

* <a href="https://wicg.github.io/webcomponents/spec/imports/">HTML imports</a>

## Script gadgets ## {#script-gadgets}

While Trusted Types logic is called on many operations that results in creating
DOM trees from string, it should not be treated as a mechanism for guarding all
DOM tree creation in a document. This is important especially in the presence of
[script gadgets](https://github.com/google/security-research-pocs/tree/master/script-gadgets),
where an application reacts to contents of usually benign DOM elements or attributes.
Developers using DOM API directly can trigger such gadgets without using
Trusted Types. However, in order for the gadget to trigger DOM XSS, it needs to
obtain a Trusted Type value via a policy. Authors need to ascertain that the data
passed to Trusted Type policies is indeed trustworthy, if the policy rules don't
enforce constraints or validate the data themselves.

## Best practices for policy design ## {#best-practices-for-policy-design}

Trusted Types limit the scope of the code that can introduce
vulnerabilities via [=injection sinks=] to the implementation of [=policies=].
In this design, insecure policies can still expose [=injection sinks=] to untrusted data.
Special emphasis needs to be taken by use policies that are either secure for all
possible inputs, or limit the access to insecure policies, such that they are only
called with non-attacker controlled inputs.

As policies are custom JavaScript code, they may be written in a way that heavily
depends on a global state. We advise against this. The policies should
be self-contained as much as possible. All objects that may alter security decisions
a policy makes effectively *become* the policy, and should be guarded & reviewed
together.

Issue: Refer to the external document on secure policy design.

# Privacy Considerations # {#privacy-considerations}

The specification may partially observe and alter the behavior of scripts running
within the application, e.g. causing certain operations on [=injection sinks=]
to fail, or monitoring and changing their effect with a [=TrustedTypePolicyFactory/default policy=].
However, early-running scripts already have this capability by overriding
appropriate property descriptors.

It is possible for the application to report violations of Trusted Types
restrictions. Violation reports would include the trimmed-down payload passed to
the injection sink (40 characters, including the sink name). These feature is
reusing the Content Security Policy reporting mechanisms.

# Implementation Considerations # {#implementation-considerations}

## Vendor-specific Extensions and Addons ## {#vendor-specific-extensions-and-addons}

Restriction imposed by Trusted Types SHOULD
NOT interfere with the operation of user-agent features like addons,
extensions, or bookmarklets. These kinds of features generally advance
the user’s priority over page authors, as espoused in
[[html-design-principles]]. Specifically, extensions SHOULD be able to pass strings
to the [=injection sinks=] without triggering [=TrustedTypePolicyFactory/default policy=]
execution, violation generation, or the rejection of the value.
